What's OpenVAS2Report?
======================

The idea is very simple:

# Take an OpenVAS report, in it horrible XML formart.
# Convert it into an beautiful Excel, ready to give to your boss.

Why?
====

I'm security auditor and I really hate to pass OpenVAS XML report into to and Excel document. This is a work for a monkey, not for a human! (Yes: security auditors are humans too. I know, I know. It's incredible)

So I started to develop this project and I thought share it for help other auditors that also hate make a monkey's work.
